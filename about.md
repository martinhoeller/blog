<img src="../assets/profile.png">
I am a freelance developer based in Berlin, Germany. My main expertise is on Apple's platforms (iOS / iPadOS, macOS, watchOS, tvOS).

Originally I am from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graz" target="_blank">Graz, Austria</a> but I moved to Berlin in 2013. Besides writing software I also like food, travelling, music, swimming and photography.
